## Description

This project was created to allow a user to answer questions in the terminal as they relate to their project and have a README document created for them.  During this project, I learned a lot about node and npm, specifically with using tools like FS and Inquirer.  I also learned about destructuring an array to easily access the data and then use template literals to place that data into my project where it can be written to my new file.

## Installation

To create and run this project I installed Inquirer v 8.2.4

...

## Usage

To use this project, you must first install Inquirer.  After Inquirer has been installed, open the terminal and type "node index.js" and hit enter.  Answer all of the questions as they relate to the project you are working on, and after all questions have been answered, a README document will be created for you.
